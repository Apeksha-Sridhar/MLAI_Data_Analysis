# MLAI_Module5

## Overview
This project is a Practical Assignment Module 5. Here I examine the characteristics of passangers that receive a coupon while driving. 
Here is the link to the Jupyter notebook: 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

## Findings General

1. The Bar and expensive restaraunt coupons were the least accepted type of coupon.
2. The Carry Out and cheap restaurants wre the highest accepted coupons.
2. The age groups most likely to accept coupons are between 20-35 years.

# Findings for Bar Coupons
>>>>>>> 3768fcb (updated notebook with correct file)

The following characteristics of passangers are most likely associtaed with accepting the bar coupon:

1. Younger drivers (mostlly 21 and 26 year olds),
2. Those who go to bars between 1 and 3 times a month,
3. Those who do drive alone and
4. Those who are in occupations other than farming, fishing and forestery are more likely to accept the bar coupon

## Findings for Coffee House Coupon

# Findings for Coffee House Coupon
>>>>>>> 3768fcb (updated notebook with correct file)

The following characteristics of passangers are most likely associtaed with accepting the Coffee House coupon:

1. Drivers (especially male) below 21
3. Females between 25 and 30 years old 
4. Divorced and Single drivers 

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. Sending out Bar coupons can be targetted to young adults who go to bars often
2. Bar coupons can be avoided to those driving in carpool lane, as they would not be driving alone, reducing their chances of accepting the coupon
3. Another factor we should potentitally consider that is not in this dataset is what day of the week would they be most likely to accept the coupon.
4. Sending out Coffee House coupons can be targetted to drivers under 21 years, especially males
5. Those who are single and divorced can be prioritized for Coffee House coupons
